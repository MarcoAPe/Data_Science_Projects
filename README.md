# Data_Science_(U-Camp)_Projects
This repository contains every project developed in the Data Science and AI Bootcamp by U-Camp. In parenthesis for every project there will be a description in terms of the business department which could use the data insights of the data set.

## Project 1: Python for Data Science.
- Description: In this project we analized two small Mobile selling datasets to answer basic querys and then made visualizations to better explain them.
- Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn usage for data analytics and Matplotlib for visualizations.

## Project 2: Data Cleaning and data preprocessing.
- Description: In this project we worked on a loan data set, first doing an exploratory analysis of the data, dealing with missing values and outliers, transforming categorical values, scaling and finally reducing dimensions for modeling.
- Tools: Sklearn Imputer, Labeling, Scaler and PCA functions usage for data preprocessing.

## Project 3: Supervised learning (regression and clasiffication prediction model design).
- Desription: In this project we worked on Human Resources dataset, to first predict the salary of an employee based on education, years of experience, work position and number of children as a regression model, and second predict whether or not an applicant would stay in a position based on the rest of the variables.
- Tools: Sklearn preprocessing, Linear and Non-linear regression models and Clasification models application, Metrics and Sscore usage for modeling analysis.
