# Data_Science_Projects
This repository contains every project developed in the Data Science and AI Bootcamp by U-Camp

## Module 1 tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib usage for data analytics and visualizations.
Description: In this project we analized two small Mobile selling datasets to answer basic querys and then made visualizations to better explain them.

## Module 2 tools: Sklearn Imputer, Labeling, Scaler and PCA functions usage for data preprocessing.
Description: In this project we worked on a loan data set, first doing an exploratory analysis of the data, dealing with missing values and outliers, transforming categorical values, scaling and finally reducing dimensions for modeling.

[Project 2: Data cleaning and data preprocessing](https://github.com/MarcoAPe/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Proyecto_M2_Limpieza_y_preprocesado_de_datos.ipynb)

## Module 3 tools: Sklearn preprocessing, Linear and Non-linear regression models, Scores, Categorical models.
Desription: In this project we worked on Human Resources dataset, to first predict the salary of an employee based on education, years of experience, work position and number of children as a regression model, and second predict whether or not an applicant would stay in a position based on the rest of the variables.
